# Authenticate Users with a token

## Generate a token with the example code

This section takes `Example.java` as an example to show how to generate a token with the sample code.

Before proceeding, ensure that you have installed a Java IDE.

1. Download or clone the [Rtc-token](https://github.com/beegi22/rtc-token-java) repository.
2. Open the `src/main/java/src/example.java` file, replace the value of `appID`, `appCertificate`, `channelName`, and `uid` with your own, and comment out the code snippets of `buildTokenWithUid`.
3. Run the example project. Your token is generated and printed in your IDE.
